As the deidentification approach retains the time of day, we know the patient was transfered at 2:34 AM from the medicine ward to the trauma/surgical intensive care unit (TSICU). The patient spent approximately three days in the TSICU. Note that there are two rows associated with the same care unit (TSICU). This is not an error, and this phenomenon can occur when a patient moves from one physical location to another which have the same designation. In this case, it is likely that the patient moved beds within the same physical location, though it is also possible that the TSICU care unit physically corresponds to more than one room, and the patient was moved between the two rooms. After their stay in the ICU, the patient was transferred to a vascular ward in the hospital. After four days in the vascular ward, the patient is discharged from the hospital.
